### **Final Interpretation for Wine Clusters**  

**1. Summary of Clustering Analysis:**  
- We performed **K-Means clustering** on the wine dataset.  
- Based on the **Elbow Method (Inertia)**, **K=3** was suggested.  
- Based on the **Silhouette Score**, **K=2 was the best choice (0.657)**, indicating better-separated clusters.  
- **Pair plots** confirmed that **K=2 provided the clearest separation** among clusters.

**2. Interpretation of Clusters (K=2 Chosen as Best Option):**  
- The dataset naturally divides into **two well-defined groups**.  
- The two clusters likely represent **two main wine categories** based on their chemical composition.  
- Differences between the clusters suggest **variations in alcohol content,color, or acidity levels**.  
- Feature importance (from pair plots) indicates that **some variables contribute significantly to cluster separation** (e.g.proline etc.).

**Final Conclusion:**  
**K=2 is the optimal number of clusters**, as it provides the best-separated groups. This segmentation can help in better understanding the composition and quality of different wines.However many of the clusters are not that clearly separated so this dataset migth not be best for clustering or other clustering methods should be used.
